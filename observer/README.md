Design Pattern: Observer
This program demonstrates and effective use of the Observer design pattern.

What this program does is model the Observer design pattern as seen by the perspective of a newspaper. Obviously papars are dependent on subscribers, and they want their subscribers to know when there's new material for them to read. If the material isn't up to snuff, the subscribers are probably going to leave. But if it's good, maybe they'll tell their friends about you, and they'll add to your subscription base! Yay!!
